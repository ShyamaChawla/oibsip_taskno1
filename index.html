                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Your Scent's journey began with our CEO and founders, Shyama and Divya. His discovery of the world of perfumery happened during a work trip to Iran in 2017. The traditional perfume stalls of Persia with their infinite scent choices inspired them to bring a modern interpretation of this art to their home country. Through a  unique blend of tradition and innovation, they along with three others, set out to create a truly one-of-a-kind experience of perfume-making in India and the rest is history. This team of four includes Shyama, a.k.a. the IT architect-turned-perfumer as leader of the pack; Divya, the motivator and dicer who plays with ideas in business; Riya, the dynamic diplomat in sales; and Siya, the creative digital explorer. They are the pillars of Your Scent today.
